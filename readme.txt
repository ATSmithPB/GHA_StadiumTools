This project is in development...

GHA_StadiumTools : contains source code for a StadiumTools Grasshopper Assembly (StadiumTools.gha) 
...for use as a plugin in Rhinoceros3D + Grasshopper

StadiumTools : contains source code for a core StadiumTools Dynamic Link Library (StadiumTools.dll) 
...for use within .NET Framework 4.8+

StadiumTools_IO : contains source code for a StadiumTools_IO Dynamic Link Library (StadiumTools_IO.dll) 
...for converting between rhinoCommon and StadiumTools classes/structs/interfaces.

future plans include a Revit plugin, UE5 support, and hopefully a web interface :)
